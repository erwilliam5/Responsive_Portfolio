# Homework 2 - Responsive Portfolio

# Motivation
I hope this space can be an ever-changing slate for my personal portfolio and contact info. I've had websites in the past that I didn't update very well; partially because I change my mind so much and also partially because I didn't feel that I had much to showcase. I'm excited to share more that I've learned & continue both the learning and the sharing.
